						<p>For me, integrating multi-disciplinary beliefs and practices in my work
						is what makes possible deep, progressive engagement. As a Teacher,
						Artist and Designer, I promote this ethos and aspire to advance in a
						variety of disciplines.</p>

						<p>Installation art was my preferred means of expression late in my
						undergraduate career. After graduating, I found myself digging deeper
						into issues concerning habitable spaces. I thought it apropos to study
						architecture. My ambitions were to understand the structure of built
						form and the consequences of formal composition, tectonic and spatial
						manipulation, and to more intimately appreciate and apprehend the
						experience of inhabitation in regards to structure, scale and site. I
						began to see my interests in art making shifting to a more macro level,
						as I wanted to define for myself what a confluence of art and
						architecture could be. I’m now developing these ideas further with a
						few processes: using ink drawings, handmade graphics, artist books,
						collages and paper works, I am exploring the human condition and our
						connection to the envrionment, and representing Gestalt perception of
						how we interpret our surroundings with repeated forms and
						patterning. Gestalt theory suggests we are driven to experience our
						immediate world in a holistic manner.</p>

						<p>Along with these 2-dimensional explorations, I am also developing a
						large 3-dimensional experience with a musician. This collaboration
						will include an installation piece that will visually define the physics of
						sound traveling in space within a set of golden ratio tones. For me,
						sound is a profound medium across all cultures, especially music.
						Music is a universal and sometimes uniting form of art that can impact
						us at a very primal level. Understanding the holistic connections we
						makeas we hear music will be essential to constructing the structure.
						The final installation’s built forms will be defined by a performance of
						the golden ratio score.</p>
